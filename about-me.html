      <h2>Hi.</h2>
      <p>I grew up in the wilds of Idaho always dreaming of exploring the world and living near the ocean. I'm a graphic designer, passionate gardener, expert pie maker, adept cat wrangler, and have been known to repair the occasional appliance. Basically, I'm a problem solver and always game to learn something new.​​​​​​​</p>
      <p>I'm open to new projects, job opportunities, and creating good stuff for good people.</p>
